#  Journal Lab 1

With this project I was able to:

Upon launch, see a tableView with all entries (there will be no entries if you haven’t created any yet, or have deleted all of them).

Click the add button in the top right corner and navigate to the EntryDetailViewController.

Hit the clear button at the bottom of the screen and see you text field and text view become empty.

Click the save button in the top right corner of the EntryDetailViewController and be navigated back to the EntryListTableViewController, where you should then see your newly created entry.

Click on an entry in the EntryListTableViewController and be navigated to the EntryDetailViewController where you should see that entry’s title and body text (if you click save here it should simply navigate you back to the EntryListTableViewController and your debug console should prompt you with a message that says: “to be implemented tomorrow”).
